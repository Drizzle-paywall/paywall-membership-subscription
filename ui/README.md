Shared components and styles to use in Drizzle apps.

## Running Storybook
Use [react-storybook](https://github.com/kadirahq/react-storybook/) to implement components without waiting for Meteor builds all the time. This project uses hot reloading to update components in real-time.

```
npm install
npm run storybook
```

Go to <a href="http://localhost:9001">localhost:9001</a> and start development.
