# Drizzle paywall
Drizzle paywall is simple scalable and most user-friendly paywall, subscription and membership product. It's built using React, JS, Meteor, Node, MongoDB. It's compatible with any web technology and stack. Implemented natively, not via external JS file. It takes about 30 min to set up and deploy product, and only 5 min to install it on any type of website. Data is paywalled via server-side method, not client-side. If you are on Wordpress or Drupal, you are in luck, contact Kelly (kelly@getdrizzle.com) and we can provide WP plugin or Drupal module to make installation even smoother (via API key). This product is built mainly by @klyburke, @delgermurun and me with contributions from @lnmunhoz.
